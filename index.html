    <!-- NOTE: reminder that you can use methods like this, but I won't be doing this often. i like to execute methods using events like click, mouseover, load etc. -->
    <!-- for our certain case, this function will run each time our app is rendered. again, not ideal, but for learning vue, its coo. -->
    <p>{{outputGoal()}}</p>
    <!-- NOTE: for this outputGoal2(), we are changing the return value from courseGoalA to courseGoalB, as appropriate, by accessing our data properties in our method. for the first example, we are just using strings. look at the js file to see the difference -->
