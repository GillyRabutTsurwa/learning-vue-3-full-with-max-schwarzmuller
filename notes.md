## Ce que l'on a appris
* Max went through how powerful Vue is and what it does behind the scenes par rapport au l'attachement de l'evenement (event binding)
* These are lesssons 20-22
* We learnt about events (for now, just the click event, similar to the click event listener in javascript)
* we learnt how to add logic inline (not preferred) and how to make methods that call our button logic once clicked (preffered and imporant concept).
